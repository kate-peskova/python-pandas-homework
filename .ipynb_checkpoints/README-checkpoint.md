# A Whale Off the Portfolio

This project consists of two blocks.

## Block 1. Preparing, reading, and analyzing provided data from three portolios.

In the first block, we are uploading the data from .csv files that show dates and closing prices for three portfolios. We are converting the retrieved data into data frames and creating a one joined data frame that shows all three portfolios side by side. We are then running various financial analysis, such as standard deviation, rolling beta, and Sharpe ratios for our portfolios and plotting the accumulated data.

## Block 2. Creating a Custom Portfolio.

In the second block, we are customizing a new portfolio by selecting the stocks of our choice. We are uploading the data through Google Docs, GOOGLEFINANCE function and downloading it into new.csv files. After that, we are creating new data frames, combining them, running financial analysis, and plotting them, similar to the previous block. Finally, we are comparing our customized portfolio assets and writing the conclusion.

Please refer to the code’s markdown comments for step-by-step description of the project.
